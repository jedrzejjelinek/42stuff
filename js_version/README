What's done
"""""""""""
* sorting algorythm
* possibility to define what metrics should be used for sorting particular properties
* works for multiple properties and metrics
* some unit tests for data loaders
* different data loaders (memory, files, ...)
* data.txt is sorted in result.txt file


What should be done
"""""""""""""""""""
there are some TODOS in my code. Most important are:
* data is loaded from file into memory - for laaaarge files it could be slow and expensive. There should be some kind of generators / iterators used
* data parser should check for invalid data (corner cases like empty file, duplicated data, more headers than items in row, etc...)
* structure returned by parser is a pain in the ass in some places..
* printing methods should be separated from logic (vide hierarchicalSort.js)
* maybe sortAndPrint should be iterative not recursive - due to memory usage for large files, but I didn't check that
