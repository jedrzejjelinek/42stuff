// TODO notes

// what about reading data: use attached examples
// 1 first version: load from memory (add reading files later)
// 2 add loading from file
// 3 test memory usage and execution time (42tech loads huge data files probably)
// should delimiter be configurable?

// what about parsing
// 1 first: assume that are 2 props only
// 2 how to parse (string comparison for headers? regex?) - test with 200 headers (probably it doesnt matter)
// 3 what data structure?

// !!! sort function
// 1 first: code simplest thing with hardcoded net_sales metric used in sorting
// 2 add configurable metrics
// 3 (extra) add possibility to configure metric per property

// display result
// 1 first: just return value - for testing purposes
// 2 print on screen
// 3 save to file
// ...or maybe just save to file, think that throug

// what about tests
// add unit tests
// kind of integrational tests using given examples
// stress tests - ? - prepare large file (maybe based on given examples?)
// what about corner cases? - think that through

// what about performance?
// fist: dont worry bout the perf, just make working algorythm
// second: try to optimize - think that through
